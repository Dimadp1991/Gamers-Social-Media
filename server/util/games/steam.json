Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.<br></li><li>\t<strong>MASSIVE WARFARE:</strong> Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.  <br></li><li>\t<strong>ENORMOUS MAPS:</strong> PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings. <br></li><li>\t<strong>PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS:</strong> In PlanetSide 2 the war isn\u2019t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.<br></li><li>\t<strong>CLASS-BASED COMBAT:</strong> Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics.

You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.<br><br><strong>Light Assault:</strong> Go where the Heavies can\u2019t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes!<br><br><strong>Combat Medic:</strong> Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. <br><br><strong>Infiltrator:</strong> Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. <br><br><strong>Engineer: </strong> Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. <br><br><strong>MAX:</strong> Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\t<strong>OUTFIT TEAMWORK:</strong> Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out.

Most of the animal wildlife wants to snack on your leg - and aggressive robot drones, alien soldiers and their guardians will try to hunt you down as soon as you are within sight. Fight for your life and deploy a range of weapons against fierce and obscure alien creatures.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/383120/extras/Enemies2.jpg?t=1549913116\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mining and Resource Gathering:</h2>For building and construction, you need to gather and mine resources.

We consider commercially significant using it on any avenue (channel) that produces you more than $500 monthly revenue. This includes ad-based revenue and voluntary donations (one time or recurrent such as a Patreon). If you are under this threshold you can use Classic, if you are above you need to upgrade to Pro or Studio.<br></li><li>the FaceRig Pro DLC, which allows you to monetize videos on YouTube/Twitch regardless of the monthly revenue, but not for content exclusive to paid/subscription based services, such as the new YouTube Red (for content that is exclusive to YouTube Red or similar you will need FaceRig Studio).<br><strong>FaceRig Pro does not bring new assets, technical features or improvements to FaceRig Classic. </strong> For more details, take a look at the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/315200\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Pro DLC description </a><br></li><li>the Studio Version allows commercial use, as well as  access to the expression mo-cap data.

In this post-apocalyptic urban world, death is waiting around every corner, at the top of high-rise buildings, and in the grasp of powerful teleporting creatures known as 'Nethers'. These creatures and the other players are real challenges to overcome, requiring tactical gameplay, awareness, stealth, and cooperation. To navigate this high-tension environment, you must use skill and cunning in order to scavenge, trade, craft or loot for food, weapons, supplies, and other resources necessary to stay alive in a desolate and dangerous city. Team up with other survivors and take advantage of group play, as a tribe, to complete treacherous world objectives, or play as a lone wolf in an attempt to endure the hostile environment. In the end you must decide whether to Prey or Pray.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><strong>EXPLORE</strong><br>The game's landscape is a beautifully conceived vision of a post apocalyptic Chicago, ravaged by disaster and time. Almost every low and high-rise building can be individually explored in a cityscape that stretches 150 blocks. Beyond the city lies the Wastelands, an unforgiving desolate landscape that is slowly sinking into the earth. <br><br><strong>SURVIVE, CRAFT, TRADE, LOOT AND SHOOT</strong><br>Start off, armed only with a kitchen knife and scavenge your way through an environment on a daily battle to stay alive. Beware the Nether, poor mutated souls who roam the city in search of human flesh. Scavenge for food and water to stay nourished, and search for useful items that could be crafted into makeshift weapons to help in your battle for life.  Hunt and kill Nether to trade their body parts to the mysterious Cult located in the few markets that scatter the city. Over time, build up your skills and earn rewards for surviving each precious new day. But always beware of the other survivors who may be only one moment away from death, and see killing you and looting your possessions as their only salvation. <br><br><strong>TRIBES AND TERRITORY WARS </strong><br>Find safety in numbers by joining a tribe. Only tribes can capture and own territory, and the urban landscape is the perfect setting for turf domination. Compete with rival tribes in territory wars for control of the city by capturing strategic landmarks to reap resources and experience; prove your dominance over all other tribes. Spy on rival tribes or infiltrate and kill them by playing as a Nether. Ambush them from above by swooping in for the kill using the wing suit. Tribes change the survival experience by establishing a true social construct, with all the consequences of behavior that you would expect in the real world. Your actions have real repercussions enforced organically through reputation and standing.<br><br><strong>PLAYER AND GROUP MISSIONS</strong><br>Players can complete an assortment of individual or group missions to earn money, experience and reputation. Perform vital supply runs between the markets, work with your tribe to take down the swarms of Nether lead by the vicious boss Reaper that sporadically surge to attack neighborhoods, or keep the creatures out of the Safezones by working in groups to repair the anti-nether devices when they fail.<br><br><strong>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION </strong><br>Nether offers a wide variety of character customization and allows you to play as a male or female character. There is a huge selection of cosmetic items and player taunts to assert your individuality along with entire outfits to play roles like survivalist, soldier and biker - or even just play in your underwear.<br><br><strong>OTHER</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Host your own private servers and control your settings and player population<br></li><li>First-person perspective creates a true survival experience<br></li><li>Meld of PvE (player versus environment) and PvP (player versus player) gameplay<br></li><li>New weapons and items become available as players explore the game world<br></li><li>Up to 64 players per game server<br></li><li>Single purchase, downloadable client allows full game access without subscription</li></ul>", "short_description": "Nether is a unique, first-person, multiplayer urban survival experience.

They may be fleshed out more in the future, but they will be ready to rock from day 1</i><br><br><br><strong>Endless Worlds</strong> - The planets of GRAV are procedurally generated from composite parts.  This allows for a near infinite combination of biomes, alien sites, and dungeons.<br><br><strong>Gorgeous Visuals</strong> - Genre re-defining visuals allow you to experience fear, excitement, and trepidation in a way never seen before.<br><br><strong>Frenzied Combat</strong> - Compared to the zen-like calm of harvesting resources, combat is a wild ride which you can only hope to survive.  Both Melee and Shooting are the tools of death in GRAV.<br><br><strong>Player vs Player</strong> - Create alliances with other players, viciously kill them and take their belongings, or run from it all!  It's up to you how you interact with your fellow players.<br><br><strong>Play With Friends</strong> - GRAV is all about enjoying the experience with your friends. GRAV is client-server based so put up a server or join an official one!<br><br><strong>Powerful Base Construction</strong> - Supporting a modular contextual room based construction system allows for building bases quickly.  GRAV's building system can be used for creating an entire city, a quick base to fight off enemy players, or building an outpost deep in a dungeon to defend against the aggressive hordes. <br><br><strong>Extensive Crafting</strong> - Anything you can harvest or kill has a chance to drop Crafting Materials.  Building everything from the armor you wear, weapons you kill with, to the actual bases themselves comes from crafting.<br><br><strong>Dynamic Environmental Events</strong> - GRAV employs a procedural system to create world events for players.  A night could consist of blossoming night flowers, meteors raining down from the heavens, or even a horde of very angry alien wildlife trying to kill you and anything you have ever made. <br><br><strong>Procedurally Generated Dungeons</strong> - The planets of GRAV are full of dungeons that are created specifically for that planet.  Full of rare resources, dangerous foes, and environmental obstacles that provide a high-risk high-reward play area.<br><br><strong>Hostile Environments</strong> - Alien planets have a combination of semi safe areas and just plain you-are-probably-going to die locations!

These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch?

Have a convincing story or find yourself facing the gallows!<br><br><strong>Judgement </strong><br><br>During this phase the town will vote on the fate of the defendant. Players can vote guilty, innocent or abstain.
